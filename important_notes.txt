What I have learned today (3/15/2018)
1. Sass is a compiler for .sass and .scss files. Essentially, these compilable languages that output .css files. You can structure .scss files like any ordinary compiled language, and once sass does its job, a nicely structured .css file is returned to the programmer. 
2. Bootstrap uses sass on its .scss files. If we used node npm to install the source files of bootstrap, then we can see that the repositor contains a lot of .scss files. 
3. Bootstrap allows for the use of 12 columns in its grid system. Essentially, a grid system is the graphic designer's way of organizing the details of a webpage in an appealing manner.
