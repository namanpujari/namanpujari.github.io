                        <p class> Nice to meet you! I'm Naman, and over the last two years I've developed a very strong interest in the field of computer science. This personal website is built for the sole purpose of showcasing the things that I have created out of the very same interests. I urge you to look through the website and get to know me just a little bit better! </p>

                        <p class> I've always thought of myself as a bit of a perfectionist; I don't finish things unless I believe they are the best they can be. That being said, my general goal has always been to completely master every aspect of Computer Science and Engineering and become an individual who is in every sense a jack-of-all-trades. </p>
