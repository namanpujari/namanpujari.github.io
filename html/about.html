Here, I attended a local primary school and got to make some of my first friends. My most memorable recollections from London are usually the ones where I am having pure, genuine fun with them. </p>

          <p id = "emphasize" align = "justify"> I went to my first international school here. As such, I began learning about cultures other than mine and interacting with children of different races. In the same city, however, I was also subjected to political dispute and violence. During the 2008 election-caused unrest, I had small glimpses of the true, bloody face of violence. </p>

          <p id = "emphasize" align = "justify"> As a student in a local government school for over a year I studied alongside some of the more underprivileged children. Till date, some of my most down-to-earth friends are from there. I also had the opportunity to live in a special Foreign Ministry complex for around 2 years, where I casually shared a swimming pool with people who are now high ranked Diplomats, and even Ambassadors! </p>

            Bangkok was in many ways a medium towards social and cultural enrichment. I made tons of friends, played sports of all kinds, studied musical instruments like the Tabla, and attended Indian cultural events. I'd say much of my love, let alone acceptance, for religion and race apart from mine was fostered here. Without a doubt, I've gathered the most memories from here.

            Leave the best for last? It certainly seems like it! New York has made me transition from a boy into an independent and multi-tasking young adult. After completing my high school here, I jumped right into the college scene, and am now passionately pursuing Computer Engineering. Furthermore, I've been able to actually <b> use </b> the experience and worldly knowledge I've accumulated prior to NYC, mainly because of The Big Apple's extremely diverse demographic!
